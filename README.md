# Find Your Misfit
### Brought to you by Victoria Anderson, Doug Day, Janiece Dickens, and Sarah Subero

This project was built to help people who wouldn't normally talk to each other explore each other's point of view. It asks users to take a short personality quiz and then matches people who are most UNalike. Then it uses socket.io to set up a chat room between matches. It does not currently store conversations or messages, but that is in the plans for a future update.

Find this app deployed to [Heroku](https://find-your-misfit.herokuapp.com) here!

* The matching algorithm is still being worked on, but if you log in with the credentials email: three@example.com / pasword: password and email: four@example.com / password: password, you will be able to chat between those two users in real time.
